Problem Statement:
Home gardeners and farmers face challenges in successfully growing plants due to the varying and complex requirements of different crops and garden plants.
Many struggle with understanding soil quality, optimal crop selection, and creating suitable growing conditions, which often results in low yields, 
poor plant health, or frequent crop failure.

Solution:
Smart soil testing kits linked to an app that provide soil analysis, crop and fertilizer advice, helping gardeners and farmers reduce crop failure and 
improve yields sustainably.

Supporting Data: 40% of crops fail yearly worldwide, and 60% of home gardeners struggle to maintain plants healthy.
